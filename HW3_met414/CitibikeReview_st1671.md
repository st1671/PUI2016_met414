#### The Null Hypothesis is Non-subscribers (users) use Citibikes as much or more than subscribers Monday through Friday.    
We would better write it in formular. 
 
 $ H_0: N_{nonsub} - N_{sub} \ge 0 $    

 $ H_a: N_{nonsub} - N_{sub} < 0 $  

 $\alpha=0.05$

 Toneatto choosed the data of feburary 2015 from citibike dataset.
 He droped unneccessary varailbes and worked with usertype and  date varilables.     
 Then he assigned subscribers to "1" and unsubscribers to "2"  to prepare for following numerical process.   

 The result bar chart shows a strong evidence that the nonsubscriber use citibike much less than subscribers. Which means that we have strong confidence level to reject the null hypothesis.   

 Since the dataset has large sample size, and from the histogram we find that the distirbution was normally. We can use Z-test to test the difference of mean between number of nonsubscriber users and subscriber users.
